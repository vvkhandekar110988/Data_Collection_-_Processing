# Below, we have provided a list of tuples that contain studentsâ€™ names and their final grades in PYTHON 101. Using
# list comprehension, create a new list passed that contains the names of students who passed the class (had a final
# grade of 70 or greater).

students = [('Tommy', 95), ('Linda', 63), ('Carl', 70), ('Bob', 100), ('Raymond', 50), ('Sue', 75)]

passed = [item[0] for item in students if item[1] >= 70]

print(passed)
